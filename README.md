# Next Gen Automated Attendance Management: Computer Vision Meets GPS

**Abstract**
 The current attendance systems, including manual marking and biometric systems, often face challenges such as proxy attendance and manual verification. It integrates advanced computer vision and GPS technologies to revolutionize attendance systems with enhanced accuracy and reliability. It automatically marks attendance based on real-time facial movements, such as eye blinks or gestures, ensuring only live individuals are recorded. This prevents spoofing with static images. Additionally, GPS technology restricts attendance marking to specific geographical boundaries, ensuring records are made only within designated locations. The system also enforces recording within specified time intervals, ensuring schedule adherence. By leveraging deep learning algorithms for motion detection and geofencing techniques for location-based control, the solution offers a highly accurate and automated solution, enhancing security and reliability while reducing administrative burdens. Future developments may include scalability, integration with existing systems, and adaptation for various organizational environments.
